Q.1
"""
Create a Persistent Volume called log-volume. It should make use of a storage class name manual. It should use RWX as the access mode and have a size of 1Gi. The volume should use the hostPath /opt/volume/nginx
Next, create a PVC called log-claim requesting a minimum of 200Mi of storage. This PVC should bind to log-volume.
Mount this in a pod called logger at the location /var/www/nginx. This pod should use the image nginx:alpine.
